0. Simple Web Stack

Architecture:
[User Browser] -> [DNS: www.foobar.com -> 8.8.8.8] -> [Server: Nginx -> App Server -> MySQL DB]

Server IP: 8.8.8.8
Web Server: Nginx
Application Server: Gunicorn running Flask
Database: MySQL
Application Code: /var/www/app/

Flow:

1. User requests www.foobar.com
2. DNS resolves to server IP (8.8.8.8)
3. Nginx serves static files or forwards to App Server
4. App Server processes and queries MySQL if needed
5. Response returned to user via Nginx

DNS Type:
The www record is an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8

Issues:

- SPOF: one server fails â†’ site down
- Maintenance downtime when updating code or restarting services
- No scaling: one server cannot handle high traffic
