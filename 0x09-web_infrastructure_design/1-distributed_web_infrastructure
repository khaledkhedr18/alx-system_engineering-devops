1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

Components:

- Load Balancer: HAProxy, Round Robin, Active-Active setup
- Web Servers: Nginx + App Server (Gunicorn/Django)
- Database Cluster: MySQL Primary + Replica

Flow:

1. User requests www.foobar.com
2. DNS resolves to LB IP 8.8.8.8
3. LB distributes traffic between Server 1 and Server 2
4. Each server processes requests, queries DB as needed
5. DB Primary handles writes, Replica handles reads

Advantages:

- Better availability
- Load distribution
- Faster reads with DB Replica

Issues:

- SPOF: Load Balancer
- No HTTPS
- No firewall
- No monitoring

LB Setup:

- Algorithm: Round Robin
- Active-Active: both servers handle requests at the same time
