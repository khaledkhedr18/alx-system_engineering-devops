Secured & Monitored Web Infrastructure:

Components:

- Load Balancer: HAProxy, Round Robin, Active-Active, SSL termination
- 3 Firewalls: Network-level before LB, host-level before each Web/App Server
- HTTPS via SSL certificate for www.foobar.com
- Web/App Servers: Nginx + Gunicorn, Application Code
- MySQL DB: Primary + Replica
- Monitoring Clients on each server for logs, QPS, metrics

Flow:

1. User → DNS → LB → Firewall → Web/App Server → Database
2. Monitoring agents collect and send metrics/logs
3. HTTPS encrypts all external communication

Issues:

- SSL termination at LB leaves internal traffic unencrypted
- Single DB write node is SPOF
- Same components on all servers increases attack risk
