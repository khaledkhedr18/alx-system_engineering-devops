Scale-Up Infrastructure:

Components:

- Load Balancer Cluster: HAProxy #1 + HAProxy #2, VIP, Round Robin
- Web Servers: Nginx, serve static files & reverse proxy to App Server
- Application Server: Gunicorn/uWSGI, executes business logic
- Database Server: MySQL Primary (optionally with Replica for reads)

Why each was added:

- Extra Server: Dedicated Application Server to separate concerns
- LB Cluster: Redundancy and high availability
- Component Split: Independent scaling, isolation of failures

Flow:

1. User → DNS → LB Cluster (VIP)
2. LB forwards request to one of Web Servers
3. Web Server sends dynamic requests to App Server
4. App Server interacts with DB, returns response
5. Web Server sends final response to user
