Postmortem

Issue Summary
Duration: May 12, 2024, 14:00 - 18:30 UTC

Impact: Our primary web application experienced a complete outage, affecting approximately 85% of our users. Users were unable to log in, access their accounts, or perform any transactions during this period.

Root Cause: The root cause was a misconfigured database replication setting that led to a cascade of replication lag and eventual failure of the primary database.

Timeline
14:00 - Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating database connection failures.
14:05 - On-call engineer received the alert and began initial investigation.
14:15 - Database team notified, and initial hypothesis was a potential network issue causing replication lag.
14:30 - Misleading assumption led to network diagnostics, revealing no significant issues.
15:00 - Application team involved to check for application-level errors; no significant errors found.
15:30 - Further investigation into the database logs revealed inconsistencies in replication settings.
16:00 - Database replication settings reviewed and root cause identified as a misconfiguration.
16:30 - Incident escalated to senior database administrators to devise a recovery plan.
17:00 - Recovery plan implemented: replication settings corrected, and database restart initiated.
18:00 - Database replication stabilized, application services gradually restored.
18:30 - Full functionality verified, and outage declared resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfigured database replication setting that went unnoticed during a routine maintenance update. Specifically, an incorrect value for the sync_binlog parameter caused the primary database to fall out of sync with its replicas. This led to a growing replication lag, which eventually caused the primary database to fail as it attempted to handle a sudden increase in read/write requests alone.

Resolution:

Identified the misconfigured sync_binlog parameter.
Corrected the replication settings to the recommended values.
Restarted the database services to apply the new settings.
Monitored the replication lag and overall database health to ensure stability.
Gradually brought the application services back online, ensuring each step did not introduce additional issues.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Improved monitoring and alerting for database replication lag and configuration changes.
Implemented stricter change management processes for database configuration updates.
Enhanced cross-team communication protocols during incident response.
Tasks:

Patch Database Configuration:

Review and standardize database configuration settings across all environments.
Ensure critical parameters like sync_binlog are set correctly.
Enhance Monitoring:

Add monitoring for replication lag and alert thresholds for critical metrics.
Implement automated checks for configuration changes.
Update Change Management Process:

Introduce a mandatory review process for all database configuration changes.
Implement a checklist for routine maintenance updates to catch potential misconfigurations.
Training and Documentation:

Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on database configuration best practices.
Update internal documentation to include detailed guidelines on maintaining and troubleshooting database replication.
